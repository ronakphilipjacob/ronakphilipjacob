👋 Hi, I'm Ronak Philip Jacob

🚀 Platform Engineer | Cloud & DevOps Specialist | Infrastructure Enthusiast

I design, build, and automate scalable cloud platforms that power modern applications. With hands-on experience across Azure, Kubernetes, CI/CD, containers, infrastructure automation, and application delivery, I focus on enabling engineering teams to ship reliably and securely — with minimal friction.

💡 What I Do

Cloud Architecture & Platform Engineering across Azure (PaaS + IaaS)
Infrastructure-as-Code using Terraform, GitOps, self-service provisioning frameworks
Kubernetes Expertise – AKS, ArgoCD, Helm
CI/CD Pipeline Engineering using Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions

📌 What Drives Me

I love solving platform-level challenges — making systems more scalable, reliable, reproducible, and developer-friendly. Whether it’s a cloud landing zone, a CI/CD pipeline, a zero-touch deployment framework, or a Kubernetes-based platform, I enjoy building the glue that powers everything underneath.
